# Install codex-trace.
#
# Platform-specific, because the right artifact differs:
#   - macOS: build a proper `.app` bundle via `tauri build` and install it to
#     /Applications. `cargo install` only produces a bare Mach-O binary with no
#     Info.plist / GUI activation policy, which shows a blank white window on
#     macOS. The backend and frontend are fine; only the bundling is wrong.
#   - Linux/other: a bare binary from `cargo install` works fine (there is no
#     `.app` concept), so keep the original flow.
